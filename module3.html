                           <p>It is a factor that oftentimes determines your family values. Family,
                              especially the parents are usually the first mentors of your sexual
                              identity. They teach you about love, kindness and humility. Family’s
                              relationship lays the foundation of your personality, life options and
                              total behavior. It can also affect the strength of your social, physical,
                              mental and emotional health. Making a strong connection within
                              your family is significant in nurturing yourself.
                              Values and expectations are just two ways that family could influence
                              your attitude and sexual behaviors. A family with defined values is able to
                              withstand against other people’s contrasting principles. You see how your
                              parents interact with each other, make choices and determine right and
                              wrong to develop moral self in the family. However, when you have a weak
                              and or broken family, you may be astray and feel difficult in making right
                              decisions and correct actions. In some families, setting expectations towards
                              their children provide high regard of being successful and or depression
                              depending on how you manage and understand the set standards.</p>

                              Sexual identities and orientations, the contents of sexual behavior,
                              and the social consequences of these behaviors vary largely across
                              cultural contexts. Cultures all over the world recognized standards
                              for individuals to match your sex role prescriptions and feel
                              psychologically well adjusted.
                              Culture looks at the entirety of any given society’s belief organization,
                              laws, customs, practices, language and attitudinal variables which makes
                              people distinctive from others. What happened when you are conditioned in
                              the ways of a specific culture? You start acting and behaving in ways that
                              are suitable to such a culture. Your dress sense, grooming, language, belief
                              system and attitude become shaped to suit into that society which causes
                              you to become accepted by them. Just like for example, some ladies like
                              wearing tiny shorts are normal, while in others, it is forbidden because of
                              their family and religious beliefs. Some places allow males and females to mingle freely
                              in
                              public places, but others do not. This has a great impact on how you adapt
                              the certain culture in your own community where you belong.

                              sources of knowledge about sexuality, but they are not the most
                              effective and efficient sources. As an adolescent, you may begin to
                              spend more time with peers – friends and classmates in your age
                              group. As a result, their values and beliefs may influence you.
                              Choosing your peers are important because they influence you every
                              day. During adolescence, this influence can be mainly tough as you spend
                              more time away from home and you become more conscious of different
                              values and morals like beliefs and about right and wrong. You feel the
