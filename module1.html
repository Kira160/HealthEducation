                    yourself and deal with other people, especially with the other sex. Sexual
                    feelings are normal and healthy. As a teen, you’ll experience a heightened

                  <p>Gender refers to the characteristics of women, men, girls and boys that are socially constructed.

                    can change over time.
                    Gender is hierarchical and produces inequalities that intersect with other social and economic
                    inequalities. Gender-based discrimination intersects with other factors of discrimination, such as
                    ethnicity, socioeconomic status, disability, age, geographic location, gender identity and sexual
                    orientation, among others. This is referred to as intersectionality.</p>
